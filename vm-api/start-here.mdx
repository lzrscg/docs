<Note>
  This is API is in beta. We do not have authentication and access to these endpoints is completely free charge. This will change in the future, but until then these should not be depended on in production enviroments and are subject to change.
</Note>

## Networks
### Move
The only Move network currently available to the public is [Movement Labs' M1](https://docs.movementlabs.xyz/networks/m1). The endpoint listed in the docs automatically selects this network, so no configuration is required.
### EVM
Use the following `chain-id` values to select the network you want to query.
<Note>Chain ID is assigned by Modular Cloud. It is not the same as the `CHAIN_ID` from [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md). To avoid this name collision, our internal chain ID will eventually be deprecated.</Note>
